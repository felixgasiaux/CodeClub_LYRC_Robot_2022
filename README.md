# CodeClub_LYRC_Robot_2022
This is the repo for documenting our robot build of the 2022 LYRC. 

Team members are:
- Noé Guerien
- Kim Bourg
- Avanti Sharma 
- Félix Gasiaux 

The entire robot is built in [Level 2](https://level2.lu) in Bonnevoie.
This Team is formed from members of the [CodeClub](https://codeclub.lu) association in Luxembourg and mentored by Thierry Goniva, Jean-Phillipe Guisset and Miguel (I do not know the name sorry).

You have to add the Camera library to where you install the normal libraries. This library allows you to use the camera with the mbot.
