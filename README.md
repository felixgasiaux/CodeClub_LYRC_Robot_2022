# CodeClub_LYRC_Robot_2022
This is the repo for documenting our robot build of the 2022 LYRC. 

Team members are:
- Noé Guerien
- Kim Bourg
- Avanti Sharma 
- Félix Gasiaux 

The entire robot is built in [Level 2](https://level2.lu) in Bonnevoie.
This Team is formed from members of the [CodeClub](https://codeclub.lu) association in Luxembourg and mentored by Thierry Goniva, Jean-Phillipe Guisset and Miguel (I do not know the name sorry).

The kit consists of the following components:
-Makeblock Ultimate 2.0 kit
-Makeblock smartcam (Pixie)
-Makeblock color sensor
-up to 150g of passive enhancement(s)

We add the camera on port 6 for now and copy the library from the hidden apllication folder from the [Makeblock App](https://www.makeblock.com/software/)  for PC/Mac.
You have to add the Camera library to where you install the normal libraries. This library allows you to use the camera with the mbot.
